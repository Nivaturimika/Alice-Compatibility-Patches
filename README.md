# Alice-Compatibility-Patches
Mod compatibility patches for Project Alice

Most of these compatches are unofficial, so don't bother the modders with your issues/bugs, bother us instead!

Nomenclature is as follows:

* O_xxxx - Mods or "versions of mods" catered specifically for Alice, for example, a Country Roulette mod making use of `if/else` extensions
* A_xxxx - Actively developed mods compatch, may be out of date (and they ALWAYS are latest github commit, so use the latest github commit from them NOT RELEASE OR MODDB RELEASE)
* S_xxxx - Actively developed mods compatch, however the mods are stable enough that not a lot of revisions are needed
* D_xxxx - Discontinued/Inactive mod compatch, never out of date

# Custom mods

O_NTSC - Based off CWE, it's a mod that allows you to play as the NTSC, PAL or SECAM video standards!
O_CountryRoulette - A country roulette mod for vanilla!
O_Apocalypse1836_Compatch - A version of Apocalypse 1836, modified slightly
O_ZombieApocalypse - A version SPECIFICALLY tailored for Alice, very VERY aggressive zombies and decolonization mechanics (very fun!)
O_LPA - Low Performance Addon: Turns graphical settings to toaster levels so you can run this faster! (hopefully!)
