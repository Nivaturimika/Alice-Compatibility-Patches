# Alice-Compatibility-Patches
Mod compatibility patches for Project Alice

Most of these compatches are unofficial, so don't bother the modders with your issues/bugs, bother us instead!

Nomenclature is as follows:

* O_xxxx - Mods or "versions of mods" catered specifically for Alice, for example, a Country Roulette mod making use of `if/else` extensions
* A_xxxx - Actively developed mods compatch, may be out of date (and they ALWAYS are latest github commit, so use the latest github commit from them NOT RELEASE OR MODDB RELEASE)
* S_xxxx - Actively developed mods compatch, however the mods are stable enough that not a lot of revisions are needed
* D_xxxx - Discontinued/Inactive mod compatch, never out of date
